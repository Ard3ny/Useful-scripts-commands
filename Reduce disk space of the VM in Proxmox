------------------Reducing space tldr------------------
Kill filesystem proceses -> Unmount filesystem -> Resize && reduce filesystem -> Remove partition -> Descrease disk space in Proxmox with QM 

IMPORTANT:
1. Reducing volume size CAN NOT be performed while file system is mounted and may take a LONG time.
2. You will need to boot from a Rescue CD in order to be able to reduce the size of a volume which holds root file system.
3. Improper reduction of a volume size WILL DESTROY YOUR DATA.



#Check the running processess for mount and either kill them or use force umount or basic umount (preffered)
lsof | grep /var

#Using basic umount (preffered)
umount /var
#Using force 
umount -f /var

#Check the filesystem integrity (n for dry run)
e2fsck -nf /dev/debian11-template-vg/var
e2fsck -yf /dev/debian11-template-vg/var

            #if not working cos resource is busy
            touch /forcefsck
            reboot now

#Resize filesystem && reduce space
#reduce less space than you need bcs its 10Gib not 10Gbs
#also let some overhead so you dont delete an existing data 
lvreduce --resizefs -L -10G /dev/mapper/LV_group_name 

#Remove physical volume from VG-volume group
pvdisplay
vgreduce VG_name /dev/sda?

#Delete physical volume
pvremove /deb/sda?
pvdisplay

#Decrament space in the Proxmox 
Shutdown VM in which you want to decrament space in
#log into node with desired VM

#Find VM ID
qm list
#Edit the config of the VM inside proxmox node

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PROXMOX USING LVM STORAGE (not zfs..)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
vim /etc/pve/local/qemu-server/133.conf 
    #Edit size=<newsize>

#Reduce size in lvm on Proxmox
lvreduce -L -10G /dev/pve/vm-133-disk-0

#Rescan for GUI 
qm rescan
