If you ever have problem with Reminna when you cant RDP to Windows (usually older machine) and while troubleshooting you encounter these errors:

"Could not connect via tls see debug remina"
or
[ERROR][com.freerdp.core] - transport_connect_tls:freerdp_set_last_error_ex

Either:
Fix (a) Go to: Edit -> "Advanced" tab, change "Security protocol negotiation" from Automatic to either NLA,RDP,TLS (try all of them)
Fix (b)" Go to: Edit -> "Advanced" tab, change the "TLS Security Level" from default to "0 - Windows 7 compatible". Then click the "Save and Connect" button.
Fix (c): Combination of Fix(a) and Fix(b) (Usually first or second always works, but just in the case)
